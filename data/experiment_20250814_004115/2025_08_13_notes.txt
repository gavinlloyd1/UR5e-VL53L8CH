black board on the left, white board on the right

in the center,                           d = 0.498m
0.25m to the left (on the black board),  d = 0.492m
0.25m to the right (on the white board), d = 0.502m
0.25m up,                                d = 0.496m
0.25m down,                              d = 0.500m

took data from 12:40 AM - 1:06 AM
lights off in the lab, some light coming in from the hallway

lux on the black board is between 4 and 7 (the ROI footprint looks to be 4 everywhere)
lux on the white board is 4 everywhere

sensor is 1.76m from the ground
