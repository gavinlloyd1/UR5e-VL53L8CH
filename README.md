This project synchronizes a Universal Robots UR5e robotic arm with the VL53L8CH Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensor to perform fully automated data acquisition.
The system can move the robotic arm's tool to predefined poses, trigger sensor measurements via the MZ-AI EVK GUI, and log pose infomration and sensor data for analysis.
